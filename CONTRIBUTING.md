## Getting Started

Story Blocks is an open-source project that utilizes generative AI to transform text into visual narratives. By combining OpenAI's text generation model and Stable Diffusion(Automatic1111) with LORA for image synthesis, this project allows users to explore new frontiers of storytelling.

### One-Click Run Google Colab

You can quickly get started with Story Blocks using Google Colab. Click the following links to run the project:

-   [Run Story Blocks in One Click](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adithya-s-k/Storyblocks/blob/main/Storyblocks.ipynb)
-   [Run Automatic1111 Web UI with API](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adithya-s-k/Storyblocks/blob/main/Storyblocks_Automatic1111.ipynb)

## Example

To provide an example of Story Blocks in action, here's a sample input prompt and accompanying visual output:

Input Prompt: "Boy going to the moon"

## Instructions for Running Story Blocks

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing ImageMagick and FFmpeg on your system, which are both required to do automated editing. Once installed, you can proceed to run `runStoryblocks.py` successfully.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

-   Python 3.x
-   Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

Follow the instructions below to install ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and clone the Story Blocks repository:

#### Step 1: Install ImageMagick

1. For Windows, download the installer from the official ImageMagick website and follow the installation instructions.
   [https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
2. For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick
    ```

    Then run the following command to fix a moviepy Imagemagick policy.xml incompatibility problem:

    ```
    !sed -i '/<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@\*"/d' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
    ```

3. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:

    ```
    brew install imagemagick
    ```

4. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```
    convert --version
    ```

    You should see the ImageMagick version information if the installation was successful.

#### Step 2: Install FFmpeg (REQUIRED FOR STORY BLOCKS TO WORK)

1. For Windows, download the FFmpeg binaries from this Windows Installer (It will download ffmpeg, ffprobe and add it to your path).
   [https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306](https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306)
2. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:

    ```
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

    For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    ```

3. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```
    ffmpeg -version
    ```

    You should see the FFmpeg version information if the installation was successful.

#### Step 3: Clone the Story Blocks Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Execute the following command to clone the Story Blocks repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/adithya-s-k/Storyblocks.git
    ```

#### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runStoryblocks.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to install the required Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
