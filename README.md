# Instructions for running Storyblocks

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing ImageMagick and FFmpeg on your system, which are both required to do automated editing. Once installed, you can proceed to run `runStoryblocks.py` successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

-   Python 3.x
-   Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation Steps

Follow the instructions below to install ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and clone the Storyblocks repository:

### Step 1: Install ImageMagick

1. For `Windows` download the installer from the official ImageMagick website and follow the installation instructions.
   [https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
2. For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick
    ```
    Then run the following command to fix a moviepy Imagemagick policy.xml incompatibility problem:
    ```
    !sed -i '/<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@\*"/d' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
    ```
3. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:

    ```
    brew install imagemagick
    ```

4. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```
    convert --version
    ```

    You should see the ImageMagick version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Install FFmpeg (REQUIRED FOR STORYBLOCKS TO WORK)

1. For `Windows`Download the FFmpeg binaries from this Windows Installer (It will download ffmpeg, ffprobe and add it to your path).
   [https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306](https://github.com/icedterminal/ffmpeg-installer/releases/tag/6.0.0.20230306)
2. For macOS using Homebrew, use the command:
    ```
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```
    For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the command:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
    ```
3. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```
    ffmpeg -version
    ```

    You should see the FFmpeg version information if the installation was successful.

### Step 3: Clone the Storyblocks Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Execute the following command to clone the Storyblocks repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/adithya-s-k/Storyblocks.git
    ```

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runStoryblocks.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to install the required Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running runStoryblocks.py Web Interface

Once you have successfully installed ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and the Python dependencies, you can run `runStoryblocks.py` by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `runStoryblocks.py` is located (the cloned repo).
3. Execute the following command to run the script:
    ```
    python runStoryblocks.py
    ```
4. After running the script, a Gradio interface should open at your local host on port 4000 (http://localhost:4000).
